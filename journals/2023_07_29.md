		- Source: https://hackmd.io/5GQFD0igTROtMe-tPXCxhA
		- ## Introduction:
			- Deamon of etc
			- Distributed etc directory
			- Reliable
			- ### Use cases:
				- Config
				- Service Discover
				- Distribute Lock
				- [[k8s]]
			- ### Features:
				- Simple: HTTP API/gRPC
				- Fast: 10000 wps
		- ## [[Raft]] Algorithm
			- Target: Simpler than [[Paxos]]
			- One leader and multiple follower
			- Note: [[Byzantine Generals Problem]]
			- Main Point
				- Select one server to be leader
				- Select the leader that has newer data than me
				- If log is inconsist, follower the leader.
	- [[TLS]] Demystified: Understanding the Mechanics and Compiler Support
		- Source: https://hackmd.io/8jCapa0YSKaH6mbsyU8Kmg
		- `errno` is in thread local storage, hence we can use it in multithread.
		- How compiler handle it?
		- ## Shared Library
			- Every process that used shared library will use a same memory…?
			- How about TLS?
			- System has "Thread Control Block"
			- C++ function:
				- ```cpp
				  __tls_get_addr(object_id, offset)
				  ```
				- Get two variable from GOT (Global Offset Table)
		- ## Compiler
			- How compiler let program use it like a normal variable?
			- ```
			  C++ -> LLVM IR -> DAG -> MIR (Machine IR) -> asm
			  ```
			- LLVM IR handle it with less than 100 lines code
