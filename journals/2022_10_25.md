- Changing root shell is dangerous
	- Originally, I want to add some special shell setting (ex: set zsh as root shell and apply oh-my-zsh) to local docker container's root.
	- However it's dangerous suggested by [askubuntu: Changing shell for root](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1194994/changing-shell-for-root).
	- Maybe I should create a new user to do these stuffs.
