- [[Database]]
	- [[CAP Theorem]]
		- A distributed db will only choose two of them
			- C: Consistency
			- A: Availability
			- P: Partition tolerance
		- C+P: DB need to be consistency. Hence when some of the hosts is unreachable, the **db will reject user to read or write**.
		- A+P: DB always allow user to read and write then **db will not be consist** when network is broken.
		- C <- -> A is more like spectrums
		- Example:
			- Cassandra: Availability > Consistency
			- Bank: Consistency >>> Availability (Consistency is very important for money!)
			- Redis: Consistency > Availability
			- RDBMS: Consistency > Availability
