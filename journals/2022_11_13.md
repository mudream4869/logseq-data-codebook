	- What project use GRPC
		- https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin
	- Thread safe
		- https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io/c/nBYorlFzehg?pli=1
			- Completion queues are thread-safe.
		- https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/md_doc_cpp_perf_notes.html
			- One completion queue per thread
			- `numcpu`'s threads
		- TODO Read/Write Function?
	- Thread Model (Thread Connection Stream Read Write)
		- No doc talk about this ðŸ˜©
		- [Stackoverflow Question: What is the threading/IO model of a synchronous gRPC server? (C++)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62383065/what-is-the-threading-io-model-of-a-synchronous-grpc-server-c)

			- Sync: a rpc call / a thread
			- Async: a rpc call will push a request item into completion queue

			- TODO Code view
	- Life Cycle
		- [Unary RPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#unary-rpc)
			- Client call stub server's stub method
			- Server waits for client's request message
			- Server return response
			- Client get response
		- [Bidirectional streaming RPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc)
			- Client call stub server's stub method
			- Server waits for client to start streaming messages
			- Two streams are independent. **Read and write can be any order**. For examples:
				- A server can wait until client send all its messages
				- Server and client play ping-pong
