		- https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin
	- Thread safe
		- https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io/c/nBYorlFzehg?pli=1
			- Completion queues are thread-safe.
		- https://grpc.github.io/grpc/cpp/md_doc_cpp_perf_notes.html
			- One completion queue per thread
			- `numcpu`'s threads
		- DONE Read/Write Function?
	- Thread Model (Thread Connection Stream Read Write)
		- No doc talk about this ðŸ˜©

			- Sync: a rpc call / a thread
			- Async: a rpc call will push a request item into completion queue

			- Client call stub server's stub method
			- Server waits for client's request message
			- Server return response
			- Client get response

			- Client call stub server's stub method
			- Server waits for client to start streaming messages
			- Two streams are independent. **Read and write can be any order**. For examples:
				- A server can wait until client send all its messages
				- Server and client play ping-pong
