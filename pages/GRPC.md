- GRPC = Google Remote Process Call
- A connection can multiplex many streams, since GRPC is built based on HTTP2
- ## Usage
	- https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin
- ## [[Thread Model]]
	- ### Sync Model
		- ![grpc-sync-thread-model.png](../assets/grpc-sync-thread-model_1668420571995_0.png)
		- The GRPC will create a thread for each incoming stream.
	- ### Async Model
		- [Google group: GRPC Server Threading](https://groups.google.com/g/grpc-io/c/Cul6fd7cOB0/m/bMP5f9mdBAAJ)
			- > Hello,
			  Yes, you need to provide your own thread pool for the async model if you want multithreaded RPC processing of RPCs. The most straightforward example, IMO, is in test/cpp/thread_stress_test.cc .
