- # ACID
	- ## Atomic
		- Every transaction should be done or never do. No mid-state.
	- ## Consistency
		- States should be always OK.
	- ## Isolation
	- ## Durability
		- Data never loss.
		- Example implementation: Write-ahead logging
- # Lock
	- To sync between transactions, we need **lock**.
	- ## Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)
		- Core: We **seldom** need to sync. Do remedies (ex: retry?) after conflicts occur.
		- Example: version control systems like Git/SVN ...
		- Implement:
			- [[Algorithm/Lock/CAS]]
			- [[Algorithm/Lock/RedLock]]
	- ## Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC)
		- Core: We **always** need to sync. Visit after lock.
